When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you're collaborating.
    When using different computers at different places, eg work or home.
    Storage capacity?? Maintenance requirements on local machine??

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Same as for pushing automatically - logical chunks of code, disturbs workflow less.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: are clones, within GitHub, of another person's repo
    Clones: are copies of another repo, they can be copies of local or remote repos
    Branch: internal repo structure for controlling alternative program versions

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
