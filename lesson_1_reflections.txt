How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it was much quicker and clearer

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Typos are hard to find and slow down progress.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    manually: logical breaks, working code, reasonable size saved
    automatically: too many saves, not necessarily working code

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It is quicker and a complete snapshot.
    Saving separately requires less memory.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Know what others have been doing to a file.
    Remember what has been done.
    Know where a possible repair didn't work.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I know I can always go back to a working version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Tracking my changes rather than many confusing versions on my laptop.
